# MLCNN-LSTM-COV
This repository contains the Python code for the MLCNN-LSTM-COV, Inceptionv3-LSTM-COV, MLCNN-COV, Inceptionv3, MobileNetv2, DenseNet201, VGG19, Xception, and CNN-BLSTM models used to predict adverse COVID drug reactions.
I Dataset: This file consists of two sub-files:  sub-files 1: The first file, * Multi-Label Representation of Adverse Covid Drug Reactions.csv *, contains a multi-label dataset of 17 drug samples and 29 adverse COVID drug reactions. Each row represents a drug, identified by its PubChem_ID, along with corresponding adverse reactions. The binary values in this file indicate '1' for the presence of an adverse reaction and '0' for its absence. The column names represent specific adverse reactions: - 0: Abdominal Cramps, 1: Abdominal Pain, 2: Asthma Attack, 3: Blood Pressure Increased, 4: Changes in Taste, 5: Chills, 6: Constipation, 7: Decreased Appetite, 8: Diarrhea, 9: Dizziness, 10: Drowsiness, 11: Fever, 12: Headache, 13: Heartburn, 14: Irregular Heartbeat, 15: Liver Function Test Abnormal, 16: Muscle Pain, 17: Nausea, 18: Rash, 19: Seizures, 20: Sore Mouth, 21: Sweating, 22: Swelling, 23: Stomach Upset, 24: Tired and Heavy, 25: Trouble Breathing, 26: Trouble Sleeping, 27: Vomiting, and 28: Weakness.  sub-files 2: The second file, *Conformer*, contains the chemical conformers of the 17 drugs, named according to their PubChem_ID.
II Model Performance: It includes the Python code for measuring the performance of the following models: Inceptionv3-LSTM-COV, MLCNN-COV, Inceptionv3, MobileNetv2, DenseNet201, VGG19, Xception, CNN-BLSTM, and MLCNN-LSTM-COV, evaluated in terms of Hamming Loss (H-L), Average Accuracy, Macro Precision (MacP), Weighted Precision (WeiP), Micro Precision (MicP), Macro Recall (MacR), Weighted Recall (WeiR), Micro Recall (MicR), Macro F1 (MacF1), Weighted F1 (WeiF1), Micro F1 (MicF1), and ROC score.
III Co-Occurrence Detection Rate of Adverse COVID Drug Reactions: It includes the Python code for evaluating the co-occurrence detection rates of the following models: Inceptionv3-LSTM-COV, MLCNN-COV, Inceptionv3, MobileNetv2, DenseNet201, VGG19, Xception, CNN-BLSTM, and MLCNN-LSTM-COV.
IV Anova Test: The ANOVA file contains the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test for analysing the results of multiple classifiers.
V Time Analysis: The Python code for measuring the running times of the classifiers is provided in this file.
